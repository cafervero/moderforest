Were making our project eligible to be features in the mozilla collection of open source science projects. This is our [first millestone](https://github.com/cafervero/moderforest/milestones/Project%20eligible%20to%20be%20featured%20in%20the%20mozilla%20collection%20of%20open%20source%20science%20projects). Why?

We would like to defining and communicating our open project in a way that engages lots of contributors, in a way that engages you. We think that Mozilla science projects is the best starting point.
