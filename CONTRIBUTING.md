## Ask for a feature
Maybe you have some ideas for ModerForest, even if you are not able to develop them yourself. Don't hesitate to tell us those ideas. Maybe they are yet in our
roadmap, but perhaps it's the next crazy cool thing we want to work in.

You can use issues for this task. Remember you can add the tag `enhancenment` to that issue, it will be easier to know it isn't a bug.
