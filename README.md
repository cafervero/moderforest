# ModERFoRest
ModERFoRest name is an acronym that stands for Modelling Environmental Requirements for Forest Restoration. This piece of software aims to assist in management decision process or in species distribution studies. Other uses will be tested. It uses environmental niche models to predict species distribution areas, using only presence data and providing statistical validation.

ModERFoRest is composed by three modules (SDM: Species Distribution Modeling; FSR: Forest Stand Resemblance; SSER: Species Suitability for Ecosystem Restoration) and one main core which contains the algorithms used in the different modules. The program also has a little selection of tools. Actually, an environmental variables editor and an edhapic variables calculator are available. 

ModERFoRest uses Qt C++ libraries in order to be platform agnostic.
