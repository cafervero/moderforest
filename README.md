<em>ModERFoRest</em> name is an acronym that stands for <em>Modelling Environmental Requirements for Forest Restoration</em>. This piece of software aims to assist in management decision process or in species distribution studies. Other uses will be tested. It uses environmental niche models to predict species distribution areas, using only presence data and providing statistical validation.

ModERFoRest is composed by three modules <em>(SDM: Species Distribution Modeling; FSR: Forest Stand Resemblance; SSER: Species Suitability for Ecosystem Restoration)</em> and one main core which contains the algorithms used in the different modules. The program also has a small selection of tools. Actually, an environmental variables editor, a species editor and an edhapic variables calculator are available, but it is planned to add a calculator of hydrological datasets and comparisons of environmental niches in comming releases. In the medium term we will use <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">GDAL</a> as well.

ModERFoRest uses Qt C++ libraries in order to be platform agnostic. Nevertheless, only project files for GNU/Linux and MS Windows are available. If you are a Mac OS developer and are interested in forest repopulation, please take a look at [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTIN.md) file and join us!
