# ModERFoRest
ModERFoRest name is an acronym that stands for Modelling Environmental Requirements for Forest Restoration. This is a desktop application that is going to be very useful in reforestation processes, allowing forest engineers to choose the most suitable species and the most appropiate seeds for a specific geographic area.

ModERFoRest is composed by three modules (SDM: Species Distribution Modeling; FSR: Forest Stand Resemblance; SSER: Species Suitability for Ecosystem Restoration) and one main core which contains the algorithms used in the different modules. This software aims to assist in management decision process or in species distribution studies. Other uses will be tested. It uses environmental niche models to predict species distribution areas, using only presence data and providing statistical validation.
